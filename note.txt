3 Pillars that Good HTML and CSS need to have:

1/ Responsive design.
2/ Mantainable and scalable code
3/ Web performance: make it smaller, so the user download less data.
    - Use a CSS preprocess.
    - Less images.
    - Compress images. 
    - Less code.
    - Less HTTP requests.

What happens to CSS when we load up a webpage?
- Load HTML -> Parse HTML -> Created the DOM (family tree with parenet, sibling,...)
- When parsed, find the css file -> Parse CSS => (Cascade, and Process CSS Final Value)
    - Cascade: process of commbing different stylesheerts and resolving conflicts between CSS rules
    into one same element; IMPORTANT keyword > SPECIFICITY > SOurce Order.
        + Specificity: Inline styles > IDS > Classes, psedudo-classes, attribute > Elemetns, psedudo-elements
- With DOM and  CSS Object Model => create the REnder Tree -> Website rendering: the visual formatting model => Final website rendered.

A CSS Rule
.my-class { <--- selector
    color: blue; <--- declaration (property: declared value)
}

HOW UNITS ARE CONVERTED FROM RELATIVE TO ABSOLUTE(PX)?
- Browsers specify a root font size for each page ( usually 16px);
- % and relative values (rem, em) are always convereted to pixel;
- % relative to their parent font size if used to measure font-size
- % relative to their parent width if used to measure length.
- em are measued to parent font-size
- em are measured relative to the current front size if used to measure length.
- rem relative to root font size
- vh and vw are % of the viewport's height and width. 
 

 Layout Architecture: Think, Build, Architect
 1/ Think: Component drive design
    - Modular building blocks that make up interfaces;
    - Held together by the layout of the page;

2/Build: BEM: block element modifier.(classname)

3/ Architect: 7/1 folders module.
